	<p> The Sterrett family enjoys visiting other decendants on Cristmas,including Miles's
	  mother. They had this tradition until 2020 when the virus Covid 19 ocurred.
	  That year and years following they stayed home for Cristmas to be safe.
	 On Cristmas morning,the children would creep downstairs from thier bedroom and survey the 
	 cristmas tree. Then, if there was nothing else to look at they would go to the playroom
	 and check the stockings. They were down there to see if there was anything interesting
	 sticking out of their stocking. If there was,they would go closer to check it out.
	 If there wasn't,they would  go to the Cristmas tree and sit down to wait for thier parents.
	 Kidding,no they would'nt! What kind of kid would do that on Cristmas morning? What they actually
	 do when they go back upstairs is stand by the cristmas tree and peek around to look at the shape of the 
	 presents and the tags on the presents.They want to know which ones were thiers.If they found one adressed
	 to them,they would survey it more closely. But the thing is, when the parents come downstairs and the
	 kids ask to open presents,the parents always insist that they eat breakfast first. It makes me so mad!
	  They have a breakfast casserole. It is delicous!And that almost makes up
	 for it.Almost.
	 And then,finally the Sterrett family opens presents.They always take turns in an order they change every year.
	 Another tradition the Sterretts have is to eat pie on April 19th and July 13th.This is because Miles's father
	 unfortunatly passed away on April 19th.Then,July 13th is his birthday.Miles's father,not Miles.</p>
